# SpookyTrack!

A mod of [PolyTrack](https://app-polytrack.kodub.com/0.4.1/) created by cwcinc and Shovelfish. This mod adds many new spooky decorations, and some functional blocks like the boost block (double lollipops), the checkpoint zone, and the finish zone! Replacing the original 13 tracks are 6 spooky tracks we have created just for this mod. These tracks were made by cwcinc, Shovelfish, Forty, Hwads, and Dorachad.
